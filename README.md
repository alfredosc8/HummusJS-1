# HummusJS

[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/hummus.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/hummus)

HummusJS is a NodeJS native addon module that provides fast and rich PDF manipulation abilities.  It was written by Gal Kahana, who after 6 years of amazing work, stopped providing support for it in 2019.

Kingston Software Solutions uses this library in several of our projects and as such it is an essential part of our business.  Because of that we have decide to maintain a non-forked version of this library so that we can keep it working with newer versions of NodeJS.  Our goal is not to add features, but simply to clean-up the library code a little and keep it it functioning.

What is special about HummusJS is that it allows for reading, writing *and* modificition of PDF's.  While there are lots of PDF libraries out there, there are no free libraries that can do all this.  Gal's desire was that someone would eventually build a pure Javascript PDF manipulation library.  We'd love to see that too! Please let us know if you are working on such a project.

Documentation is available [in the Wiki](https://github.com/KingstonSoftware/HummusJS/wiki) and we welcome contributions.
